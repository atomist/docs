The [Docker Container Runner skill][container-run-skill] runs a Docker image
when an event happens. Since you define the Docker image and are able to define
custom events and event payloads, container skills basically let you run
_anything you want whenever you want_. In other words, container skills provide
a powerful tool to trigger or schedule any task imaginable.

!!! Tip
    Use the Atomist Docker Container Runner skill to run anything you want
    whenever you want.

For most use cases, you can go directly to the [Docker Container Runner skill
page][container-run-skill] and enable it. If you need more information, this
page describes the contract between a container skill and the skill runtime,
providing details on what information is available to container skills and how
they can interact with the Atomist runtime and other external systems like
GitHub and Slack.

## Requirements

The container skill can use any Docker image that can be pulled from a Docker
registry, either public or private. There are no requirements for what needs to
be installed in the container.

## Triggers

The following events can be selected to trigger the execution of the container
skill.

-   **GitHub**
    -   **branch**: a branch is created
    -   **commit check**: a GitHub commit check is created or updated
    -   **issue or pull request comment**: a comment on an issue or pull request
        is created or updated
    -   **deleted branch**: a branch is deleted
    -   **issue**: an issue is created, updated, or closed
    -   **new repository**: a new repository is created
    -   **pull request**: a pull request is created, updated, or closed
    -   **push**: new commits are pushed to a repository
    -   **release**: a GitHub release is created, updated, or deleted
    -   **pull request review**: a request to review a pull request is created
        or updated
    -   **commit status**: the status of a commit is updated
    -   **tag**: a new tag is pushed to a repository
-   **Chat**
    -   **channel linked**: a chat channel is mapped to a GitHub repository
    -   **new user**: a new chat user is created in the chat team
    -   **user joined channel**: a new user joins a chat channel
-   **Advanced**:
    -   **Cron schedule**: scheduled using cron expression
    -   **Custom webhook**: user-defined trigger

When the skill is executed, it receives the details of the event that triggered
its execution as a JSON object provided the contents of the file pointed to by
the `ATOMIST_PAYLOAD` environment variable. The data properties available in the
**GitHub** and **Chat** events are provided by those platforms. For details on
the payloads of the different triggers, see the
[skill trigger payloads](payloads.md).

The **Cron schedule** trigger provides a mechanism to execute container skills
at regular intervals using a cron expression. A cron expression is of the format
`MINUTES HOURS DATES MONTHS DAYS`. See
[CRON Expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#CRON_expression) for valid
cron expression syntax.

The **Custom webhook** trigger provides a generic and extensible way to trigger
executions of the container skill and provide it with arbitrary data payloads.
When you add a custom webhook trigger and give it a name, after enabling the
skill you will be provided with a webhook URL. When a data payload is `POST`ed
to that URL, the skill will be executed and receive that `POST`ed data as the
contents of the file pointed to by the `ATOMIST_PAYLOAD` environment variable.
You can use the custom webhook trigger to integrate arbitrary systems with the
container skill. Any platform that can send a webhook payload, e.g.,
[Docker Hub](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/webhooks/),
[Jenkins](https://plugins.jenkins.io/outbound-webhook/),
[Jira](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/webhooks/),
[IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/maker_webhooks), even [`curl`](https://curl.haxx.se/),
can trigger the execution of a container skill, allowing you to respond to the
activity described by the webhook payload.

## Running commands

There are several ways to use the container run skill to execute a command. The
command run is determined by a combination of the Docker image and
[entrypoint/command](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#understand-how-cmd-and-entrypoint-interact "Understand how CMD and ENTRYPOINT interact")
provided in the skill configuration. The following table provides an overview of
the possible image and entrypoint configurations.

| Image           | Entrypoint and command                            | Description                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `alpine:3.12.0` | `/bin/sh -c 'cd /atm/home && ls -la | wc'`        | Runs the `alpine:3.12.0` Docker image using `/bin/sh` as the entrypoint and `-c` & `cd /atm/home && ls -la` as the command arguments<sup>&dagger;</sup>      |
| `nginx`         | _left empty_                                      | Runs the `nginx:latest` Docker image using the image provided entrypoint and command arguments                                                               |
| _left empty_    | `https://gist.github.com/â€¦/gistfile1.txt Germany` | Downloads the referenced script and runs it in a Ubuntu-based container; additional parameters are passed to the script, `Germany` in this example           |
| _left empty_    | `example-org/deploy-script bin/deploy.sh prod`    | Clones the public `example-org/deploy-script` GitHub repository and runs the `bin/deploy.sh` script passing the `prod` argument in a Ubuntu-based container. |

<sup>&dagger;</sup> The provided entrypoint and command will be split on
whitespace, respecting single (`'`) and double (`"`) quotes, with the first
element used as the single element of the container `ENTRYPOINT` array and the
remaining arguments used as the container `CMD` array.

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are available inside the container:

-   `ATOMIST_WORKSPACE_ID=AZQMH6PO7` - ID of the Atomist workspace
-   `ATOMIST_CORRELATION_ID=<UUID generate for the skill invocation>` - Unique
    execution correlation id
-   `ATOMIST_PAYLOAD=/atm/payload.json` - Pointer to a file containing the
    triggering event payload
-   `ATOMIST_PUSH=/atm/output/push.json` - Pointer to a file containing push
    instructions to persist changes to cloned repos
-   `ATOMIST_STATUS=/atm/output/status.json` - Pointer to a file containing
    skill execution status
-   `ATOMIST_INPUT_DIR=/atm/input` - Directory that can contain additional input
    like provider secrets
-   `ATOMIST_OUTPUT_DIR=/atm/output` - Directory that can be used to store
    output
-   `ATOMIST_MATCHERS_DIR=/atm/output/matchers` - Directory containing problem
    matchers used to extract eg GitHub Checks
-   `ATOMIST_MESSAGES_DIR=/atm/output/messages` - Directory containing chat
    messages to send via the runtime
-   `ATOMIST_HOME=/atm/home` - Directory containing the cloned repository source
    files
-   `ATOMIST_TOPIC=<name of PubSub topic to write responses to>` - Name of
    PubSub topic to write responses to
-   `ATOMIST_STORAGE=<name of Storage bucket to write objects to>` - Name of
    Storage bucket to write objects to
-   `ATOMIST_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT=<url for querying the GraphQL API>` - Url to the
    Atomist GraphQL endpoint

## Project

For some triggers, the skill will clone the GitHub repository and checkout the
git reference of the triggering event. The repository will be cloned into
`/atm/home`. If a SHA can be extracted from the event payload, the repository
will be cloned in a detached head state. The following triggers provided a clone
of the repository:

-   GitHub > branch
-   GitHub > commit check
-   GitHub > pull request
-   GitHub > push
-   GitHub > release
-   GitHub > commit status
-   GitHub > tag

## Skill status

The result status of a skill can be set either by the exit code of the container
or by creating a status file, with the latter taking precedence.

### Exit code

A container skill that exits its first container with a non-zero exit code will
always show as a failed skill execution unless the status
[is overwritten](#skill-status-file) by a `status.json`.

### Skill status file

Writing a status messages into `$ATOMIST_STATUS` sets the status of the skill
execution

```console
echo '{ "code": 1, "reason": "Skill failed with some strange error" }' > "$ATOMIST_STATUS"
```

The `code`, `reason` and `visibility` (setting visibility to `hidden` will hide
the skill execution from the UI) properties are supported.

## Chat messages

The skill runtime is able to process messages and send them to the configured
chat integration when JSON documents are written into the
`$ATOMIST_MESSAGES_DIR`.

The following is the format of an acceptable JSON document:

```json
{
    "users": [<chat user names>]], // can be ommitted for response message
    "channels": [<chat channel names>], // can be ommitted for response message
    "body": {} or "",
    "options": { // all optional fields
        "id": string,
        "ttl": number,
        "ts": number,
        "post": "update_only" | "always",
        "thread": string | boolean,
        "actions": [{
            "id": string,
            "command": string,
            "parameters": [{
                "name": string,
                "value": string
            }]
        }]
    }
}
```

`body` should be an object representing a Slack message with attachments or
blocks. Refer to the Slack documentation to learn more about acceptable
messages.

When writing files to `$ATOMIST_MESSAGES_DIR` it is important to not re-use file
names as each file is only processed for sending once.

The following example shows a simple Slack message that gets send into the
_#general_ channel of your Chat integration:

```console
echo '{
  "channels": ["general"],
  "body": "Hello world!"
}' > $ATOMIST_MESSAGES_DIR/hello.json
```

## Persisting changes to cloned repository

Changes to the repository contents can be automatically committed and pushed to
the Git remote. A container-skill can indicate the desire to push changes back
by writing a JSON file to `$ATOMIST_PUSH`.

The file has to follow this structure:

```typescript
interface PushConfiguration {
	strategy:
		| "pr_default_commit"
		| "pr_default"
		| "pr"
		| "commit_default"
		| "commit";
	pullRequest: {
		title: string; // title of PR
		body: string; // body preamble of PR
		labels?: string[]; // labels to be set on PR
		branchPrefix?: string; // prefix for branches that should be created; if set PR branch will be ${branchPrefix}-${push.branch}
		branch?: string; // alternative to branchPrefix setting an explicit branch name
		close?: {
			stale?: boolean; // close PRs open against same branches (base and head) when no local changes
			message?: string; // optional message to use when closeing PRs
		};
	};
	commit: {
		message: string; // commit message to use when committing changes to repository
	};
}
```

Here's an example from the
[markdownlint-skill](https://github.com/atomist-skills/markdownlint-skill/blob/bf8c9e00fdb9c0584d15822de8c8b63f1ed6cc2f/markdownlint.sh#L100-L115)

```console
jq -n --arg s "$push_strategy" --argjson l "$labels" '{
    strategy: $s,
    pullRequest: {
      title: "MarkdownLint fixes",
      body: "MarkdownLint fixed warnings and/or errors",
      branchPrefix: "markdownlint",
      labels: $l,
      close: {
        stale: true,
        message: "Closing pull request because all fixable warnings and/or errors have been fixed in base branch"
      }
    },
    commit: {
      message: "MarkdownLint fixes"
    }
}' > "$ATOMIST_PUSH"
```

## Caching

This skill will automatically cache and restore files that match the provided
glob patterns in the _File cache_ configuration parameter. The patterns will be
resolved relative to the `/atm/home` directory. For each skill execution the
cache will be restored if it was previously stored.

## Secrets

Secrets that get configured and mapped to environment variable names will be
available from within the container as environment variable values. To use
secrets in your container skill, you must first create the secret and then map
it to an environment variable:

1.  Configure your secrets from the **Manage > Integrations** page of your
    Atomist workspace.

1.  Once secrets are configured, you can add a mapping in the skill
    configuration

    ![Secrets](images/secret-map.png)

    In this example, we've added the _ZenHub token_ secret to our skill
    configuration. The token is accessible as the value of the `ZENHUB_TOKEN`
    environment variable within the container.
